# 📰 News Article Classification using NLP & Machine Learning

This project demonstrates **multi-class text classification** of news articles using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning algorithms**. It predicts the category of a given article — such as **Politics**, **Business**, **Technology**, etc. — based on its content.

> ✅ This project is part of my special portfolio highlights and shows how to handle real-world unstructured text data.
